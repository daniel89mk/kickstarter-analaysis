# Analysis
## Overview of Project
To analyze what the data is telling us and get the information we exactly need. We wanted to see the numbers for the outcomes(successul, failed, and canceled) under Theater category by Launch date and wanted to see how the outcomes look like based on the goals.

## Analysis and Challenges
I answered the questions based on the images that I added here on the top and they helped because I prefer visualization than a table of data. 
I am using Excel everyday for my current job, so I didn't encounter difficulties, but I think I still need to refresh myself on how to use certain formulas.

## Results

##### What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?
Successful outcomes were the biggest number of all catetories(successful, failed, and canceled) and there is the biggest success in the May launching. 

##### What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
The percentage of Succsseful and the percentage of Failed are symmetrical, and there was no canceled. 


##### What are some limitations of this dataset?
I don't know if there is any limitations on this dataset..

##### What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
I could use Column chart for both Theater outcomes by Launch Date and Outcomes based on Goals because it would show us visually which one has bigger numbers.
